# Software Architecture: Patterns and Practices

This repository explores various architectural styles, patterns, and best practices for designing scalable, maintainable, and robust software systems.

It is structured to provide a comprehensive introduction to software architecture, covering key architectural styles, design principles, and decision-making processes that guide the development of software systems. Each chapter delves into a different architectural style or pattern, explaining its core concepts, advantages, and practical applications.
